## _Megalodon: The Orca is no match._

Welcome aboard, shipmates! Let Megalodon be your steadfast vessel on the uncharted ocean of Big Data and Machine Learning. With our rich datasets and detailed mathematical models, there's no computational storm we can't weather together! 

> "We didn't name it 'Megalodon' for nothing. It's big, it's powerful, and it's got a heck of a bite when it comes to data crunching!" - Captain Codebeard

git clone https://github.com/megalodon-ds/megalodon.git
cd megalodon
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Navigational Tools (Usage)

1. **Start your voyage with a good map.** (Load your dataset)

```python
from megalodon import Megalodon

mega = Megalodon()

mega.load_data('your_dataset.csv')
```

2. **Plot your course.** (Design your model)

```python
mega.build_model('model_design.yaml')
```

3. **Set sail!** (Train your model)

```python
mega.train()
```

# Lifeboats (Support)

If you find yourself overboard in a sea of confusion, don't panic! Shoot a flare to our issue tracker on Github, and our dedicated crew will row to your rescue.
